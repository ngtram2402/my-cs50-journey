        <h1>What is CS50?</h1>
        <p>CS50 (Computer Science 50) is Harvard University's introductory course on computer science and the art of programming. The on-campus version of CS50x , CS50, is Harvard's largest course.</p>
        <p>An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50 teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently.</p>
        <p>This course is not just made to be completed online, it is the actual course taught to Harvard students. All lectures are filmed in Harvard and put online, along with the assignments, tutorial videos and all supporting notes. Your assignments are graded, so you are held to the same standard as the actual Harvard students.</p>
        <p>All of this is, incredibly, available completely for free on the EdX platform.</p>
        <!-- Para 2 -->
        <h1>What does CS50 teach?</h1>
        <p>
            Rather than teach just one language, CS50 introduces students to a range of “procedural” programming languages, each of which builds conceptually atop another, among them Scratch, C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript. In the course's final weeks will students also learn a bit of HTML and CSS (which are languages but not programming languages). The goal, ultimately, is for students to feel not that they “learned how to program in X” but that they “learned how to program.”
        </p>
        <!-- Para 3-->
        <h1>Is CS50 suitable for beginners?</h1>
        <p>CS50 is for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. In fact, 78% of students who took CS50 had no prior CS or programming experience.</p>
        <!--Para 4-->
        <h1>Workload and Difficulty</h1>
        <p>Demanding? Yes. I spent on average 12 hours each week, and a total of 142 hours on this course, within 3 months.</p>
        <p>Difficult? Absolutely. I struggled with Tideman (Pset3) for weeks and still can't figure it out.</p>
        <p>However, is CS50 doable? Definitely. Before CS50, I knew nothing about programming (My major is Banking and Finance, no relation to CS at all). I must admit, I've almost given up sometimes, but after 3 months, I've finally completed the course and earned my certificate! If I can, of course you can too!</p>
        <p>See <a href="journey.html">My CS50 Journey</a> for a detailed breakdown of my journey through CS50, including the time it took me to complete each week and what I did in each week's problem set.</p>
        <!--Para 5-->
        <h1>How can I earn a certificate?</h1>
        <p>Students who earn a satisfactory score on 9 problem sets (i.e., programming assignments) and a final project are eligible for a free certificate.</p>
